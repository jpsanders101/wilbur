            BIO:
            <br />
            I am a writer, researcher and editor from Manchester, currently based in Glasgow. I work as a Research Assistant with <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://deathwrites.org.uk/">the DeathWrites Network</a>, and am a volunteer Community Assistant with <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.newmumswriting.co.uk/">The New Mother’s Writing Circle</a>. I am also a part-time DFA candidate in Creative Writing at the University of Glasgow, and a parent to a toddler.
            <br />
            <br />
            RESEARCH:
            <br />
            My AHRC-funded doctorate investigates the relationships between narrative, time, and trauma, through a practice-based exploration of the impact of bereavement by suicide on narrative time. I also research Ali Smith, and experimental writing. I work across narratology, critical medical humanities, and creative writing. At the University of Glasgow I have taught courses on poetry and poetics, experimental writing, and writing the body. I co-edited the literary magazine <i className="italics">From Glasgow to Saturn</i> from 2020-2021, and currently edit the DeathWrites blog. I am a volunteer editor with the New Mother’s Writing Circle.
