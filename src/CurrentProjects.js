        in 2020. My practice-based research explores narrative time and how it
        functions; representations of bereavement by suicide; affective and
        lyric modes; and motherhood and embodiment. I am also interested in
        narrative (un)reliability, walking as creative practice, and creative
        criticism. I work across narratology, critical medical humanities and
        creative writing, and have presented my work at a variety of different
        conferences and symposia.{" "}

      <h3>Teaching</h3>
      <p>
        At the University of Glasgow, I’ve taught courses on poetry and poetics
        and writing the body. I also designed and delivered an 8-week creative
        writing course on experimental writing. I recently gave a creative
        writing workshop for the New Mothers’ Writing Circle on constraints and
        creativity.{" "}

        , co-ordinating the writers and organising workshops and symposia. In
        June 2024 we held a public-facing symposium which included an author
        panel and readings from the network, along with the launch of the
        DeathWrites Newspaper, which can be accessed{" "}

        and am continuing my work with DeathWrites to organise several events in
        2025. I am also collating and editing our anthology of new writing on
        dying, death, grief and loss.

        . I’m assisting in the curation of the first Babe Station exhibition of
        contemporary art and writing,{" "}

        supported by{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        and takes place at 125 Shaftesbury Avenue from 6-30th March 2025.
        Bringing together the work of over 20 artists and writers who are also
        mothers, the show explores the evolving relationship between motherhood
        and making art. Within this context, mess becomes not just an aesthetic
        but a condition; an obstacle; a form of critique; a mode of play; a
        process of creation; an act of revolution.
